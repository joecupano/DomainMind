RF Test and Measurement Techniques

Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
The VNA is the most versatile RF test instrument, measuring both magnitude and phase of RF signals.

S-Parameter Measurements:
- Calibration is critical: SOLT (Short-Open-Load-Thru) or TRL (Thru-Reflect-Line)
- Port extensions compensate for test cable lengths
- Time domain capability for fault location
- Dynamic range typically 100-140 dB

Applications:
- Component characterization (filters, amplifiers, antennas)
- Cable and connector testing
- Impedance matching verification
- Material property measurements

Spectrum Analyzer
Measures signal amplitude versus frequency, essential for spectral purity analysis.

Key Specifications:
- Frequency range: Audio to millimeter wave
- Resolution bandwidth (RBW): Determines frequency selectivity
- Sensitivity: Displayed Average Noise Level (DANL)
- Dynamic range: Ability to measure weak signals in presence of strong signals

Measurement Types:
- Spurious emissions testing
- Harmonic distortion analysis
- Phase noise measurements
- Occupied bandwidth measurements
- Adjacent channel power

Power Meters
Accurate measurement of RF power levels.

Sensor Types:
- Thermoelectric: Wide frequency range, good accuracy
- Diode: Fast response, lower cost
- Thermistor: High accuracy, slower response

Calibration:
- Power reference standards maintained at national laboratories
- Transfer standards used for field calibration
- Uncertainty budgets account for all error sources

Signal Generators
Provide calibrated RF signals for testing.

Types:
- Analog: Continuous wave (CW) and swept frequency
- Vector: Complex modulation capability
- Arbitrary waveform: Custom signal generation

Key Specifications:
- Frequency range and resolution
- Power range and accuracy
- Phase noise performance
- Modulation capabilities
- Switching speed

Antenna Measurements
Antenna Range Types:
- Far-field: Outdoor ranges, anechoic chambers
- Near-field: Compact ranges using reflectors
- Near-field scanning: Planar, cylindrical, spherical

Measured Parameters:
- Radiation pattern: E-plane and H-plane cuts
- Gain: Absolute or relative to standard antenna
- Polarization: Cross-polarization discrimination
- Input impedance: VSWR over frequency band

EMI/EMC Testing
Electromagnetic Interference and Compatibility testing ensures devices work in their electromagnetic environment.

Emissions Testing:
- Conducted emissions: 150 kHz to 30 MHz
- Radiated emissions: 30 MHz to 1 GHz (or higher)
- CISPR, FCC, and military standards

Immunity Testing:
- Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
- RF immunity: Conducted and radiated
- Electrical fast transients
- Surge immunity

Test Setups:
- Shielded enclosures for conducted tests
- Anechoic chambers for radiated tests
- Ground planes and measurement distances specified
- Calibrated test equipment required

Phase Noise Measurements
Phase noise is random fluctuations in signal phase, critical for oscillator characterization.

Measurement Methods:
- Direct spectrum analyzer method: Limited by analyzer noise floor
- Phase detector method: Higher sensitivity, narrow frequency range
- Cross-correlation: Reduces measurement noise floor

Specification:
- Single sideband phase noise: L(f) in dBc/Hz at offset frequency
- Integrated phase noise over specified bandwidth
- Allan variance for frequency stability

Noise Figure Measurements
Noise figure quantifies noise added by RF components and systems.

Measurement Methods:
- Y-factor method: Hot and cold noise sources
- Cold source method: Single noise source
- Noise figure analyzer: Automated measurements

Corrections:
- Loss before device under test increases measured NF
- Gain compression affects noise figure
- Temperature variations affect noise source output
