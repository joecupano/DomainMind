RF Circuit Design Principles

Introduction to RF Circuits
RF circuits operate at frequencies where component parasitic effects become significant. Traditional lumped element analysis breaks down at higher frequencies, requiring distributed element analysis and electromagnetic field theory.

Transmission Lines
Characteristic Impedance (Z0):
- Z0 = sqrt(L/C) where L is inductance per unit length and C is capacitance per unit length
- Common values: 50 ohms (coaxial), 75 ohms (video), 100 ohms (twisted pair)
- Microstrip: Z0 depends on substrate thickness, dielectric constant, and trace width

Reflection Coefficient (Γ):
- Γ = (ZL - Z0) / (ZL + Z0)
- Determines amount of signal reflected back from load
- VSWR = (1 + |Γ|) / (1 - |Γ|)

Smith Chart Applications:
- Graphical tool for impedance matching
- Plots normalized impedance and admittance
- Useful for stub matching and quarter-wave transformers

RF Amplifier Design
S-Parameters:
- S11: Input reflection coefficient
- S12: Reverse transmission coefficient
- S21: Forward transmission coefficient (gain)
- S22: Output reflection coefficient

Stability Analysis:
- Unconditional stability: K > 1 and |Δ| < 1
- Conditional stability requires careful source/load impedance selection
- Rollett's stability factor K = (1 - |S11|² - |S22|² + |Δ|²) / (2|S12||S21|)

Matching Networks:
L-networks: Single inductor and capacitor, limited Q
Pi-networks: Better bandwidth control
T-networks: Alternative configuration
Stub matching: Using transmission line sections

RF Filter Design
Filter Types:
- Low-pass: Passes frequencies below cutoff
- High-pass: Passes frequencies above cutoff
- Band-pass: Passes frequencies within specified band
- Band-stop: Rejects frequencies within specified band

Implementation Methods:
- Lumped elements (L, C): Good for lower frequencies
- Distributed elements: Microstrip, stripline for higher frequencies
- Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW): High Q, compact
- Ceramic filters: Good temperature stability

Filter Specifications:
- Insertion loss in passband
- Return loss (reflection)
- Rejection in stopband
- Group delay variation
- Power handling capability

Mixer Design
Mixer Types:
- Passive: Diode mixers, no gain, require LO power
- Active: FET mixers, can provide gain, lower LO power
- Balanced: Suppress LO leakage
- Double-balanced: Suppress both LO and RF leakage

Key Parameters:
- Conversion loss/gain
- Isolation (LO-RF, LO-IF, RF-IF)
- Intermodulation distortion
- Noise figure
- Dynamic range

Oscillator Design
Feedback Oscillators:
- Barkhausen criterion: Loop gain = 1, phase shift = 0°
- Colpitts: LC tank with capacitive feedback
- Hartley: LC tank with inductive feedback
- Crystal oscillators: High stability, low phase noise

Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs):
- Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)
- Phase detector
- Loop filter
- Reference frequency
- Applications: Frequency synthesis, clock recovery

RF Power Amplifier Classes:
Class A: Linear, low efficiency (~50%)
Class B: Push-pull, higher efficiency (~78%)
Class C: High efficiency (~90%), nonlinear
Class E: Switch-mode, very high efficiency
Class F: Harmonic tuning for improved efficiency
